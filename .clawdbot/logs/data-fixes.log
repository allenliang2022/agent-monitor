I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand the current structure and then fix each issue systematically.

[ ] Issue 1: Fix active-tasks.json - only has 1 task, needs 3 tasks (test-readme, git-commit-diff, git-tabs)
[ ] Issue 2: Fix file stats - git diff HEAD~1..HEAD only shows last commit, need branch diff against main
[ ] Issue 3: Fix Event Log - SSE events don't generate task/commit log entries
[ ] Run npm run build to verify no breakage

Now I can see the issues clearly. Let me update my understanding:

Now I have a clear picture of all three issues. Let me also check if there are any worktrees to understand what exists:

Now I can see: the worktrees `git-commit-diff` and `git-tabs` exist on disk. The `active-tasks.json` only has `test-readme`. Let me check the git branches in those worktrees to build proper task entries:
