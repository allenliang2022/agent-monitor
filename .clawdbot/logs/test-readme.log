I'll start by exploring the current project structure and reading the existing files to understand what we're working with.

Good, I now have a clear picture of the project structure. Let me check if `app/lib` exists already.

All done. Here's a summary of what was done:

**README.md** - Rewrote from the default Next.js boilerplate to a proper project README with:
- Project title and description
- 8 features listed with brief descriptions
- Tech stack table (Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, Recharts, React 19)
- Getting started instructions (`npm install`, `npm run dev`) plus other commands
- Project structure overview covering all `app/` subdirectories
- MIT license

**app/lib/format-utils.ts** - Created with three utility functions:
- `formatDuration(ms)` - converts milliseconds to human-readable strings like `"1h 5m 30s"`
- `formatRelativeTime(date)` - returns relative strings like `"2 minutes ago"` or `"just now"`
- `truncateHash(hash, len?)` - truncates git hashes to 7 chars by default

**Build**: `npm run build` passed with no errors (21 static pages, 9 API routes).

**Commit**: `532afe5` - `docs: rewrite README and add format utilities` (2 files changed, +120 -23)
